<p>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce is manufactured from the choicest ingredients
collected from various countries and scientifically blended under the
most sanitary conditions.</p>

<p>It has earned its world-wide reputation by always maintaining the
highest standard of quality through several generations.</p>

<p>Messrs. Lea &amp; Perrins alone hold the recipe for manufacturing the
original Worcestershire Sauce, and the flavor and quality of their
sauce is the recognized standard throughout the world.</p>

<p>It is known in South Africa, in India, in far China and Japan, in South
America, in Canada, as well as America.</p>

<p>It stands on the tables of every-equipped dinning car, steamship
line, luxurious hotel and in millions of homes: the housekeeper also
uses it in cooking to give zest and unequalled flavor to the simple but
delicious dishes which she prepares at home.</p>

<p>Every bottle of the original Worcestershire Sauce bears their
signature, thus:</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i_signature">
    <img
    class="p0"
    src="images/i_signature.jpg"
    alt="Lea &amp; Perrins" />
  </div>

<p>If Lea &amp; Perrins' signature does not appear on the wrapper and label,
it is not the original Worcestershire.</p>

<p>When ordering sauce, order by the name "Lea &amp; Perrins" and thus get the
original Worcestershire.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE NEW DINNER APPETIZER</h3>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>"But, isn't there something new to serve at the beginning of a dinner
in place of fruit, or soup, or oysters, or the now prohibited cocktail?"</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;there is&mdash;something new and delicious and different. It is the new
"dinner appetizer"&mdash;the piquancy and "punch" of which come from the
delicious appetizer dressing&mdash;seasoned with <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b>.</p>

<p>This Appetizer Dressing is made by combining in the proper proportions,
the finest table catsup with the finest table sauce&mdash;<b>Lea &amp; Perrins'
Sauce</b>&mdash;the original Worcestershire. It is the zest&mdash;the inimitable
flavor and the unequalled seasoning power&mdash;of <b>Lea &amp; Perrins'
Sauce</b> which makes these new first courses for dinner worthy of the
"Dinner Appetizer" name.</p>

<p>These new Dinner Appetizers are not only inexpensive and easy to
prepare at home, but they seem to surround the home table with the
attractive and costly atmosphere of the most luxurious hotel.</p>

<p>A wine, cocktail, sundae or other glass is placed in the center of a
small plate. The appetizer&mdash;tomato, devilled egg, mushroom, shrimp,
beet or olive&mdash;is arranged on lettuce leaves on the plate around
the glass, and the glass is filled with the appetizer dressing.
These are placed with an oyster or other fork on a service plate at
each individual cover just before dinner is announced and create an
attractive and appetizing impression as each guest enters the dining
room. Each appetizer and lettuce leaf is dipped in the Appetizer
Dressing just before it is eaten.</p>

<p>To vary the arrangement of these dinner appetizers the Appetizer
Dressing may be served in a tomato shell, or a green pepper case from
which all seeds and pulp have been removed, or in a little cup cut from
bread, and fried in deep fat for forty seconds to brown and harden the
surface.</p>


<blockquote>
<h4>APPETIZER DRESSING</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<ul>
  <li>2 teaspoonfuls of <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b>.</li>
  <li>4 tablespoonfuls of tomato catsup.</li>
</ul>

<p>For every individual service desired, use the above proportions of
<b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b> and tomato catsup. Add the <b>Lea &amp;
Perrins'</b> to the catsup, blend well, and put in the ice-box to
chill.</p>

<p>Place this dressing in a chilled cocktail, sundae or other glass in
the center of a small plate and serve surrounding with crisp lettuce
leaves on which tomato, devilled egg, shrimp, sardine or other
attractive dinner appetizers have been arranged. The lettuce and
appetizers are dipped in the dressing with an oyster fork and eaten.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>


<blockquote>
<h4>TOMATO APPETIZER</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>One tomato may be used for two services. Put the tomatoes in
a wire strainer and quickly dip in and out of boiling water.
Place immediately in cold water and peel. Place on ice to chill
thoroughly. When ready to serve, quarter each tomato and recut each
quarter into two or three parts, depending on the size. Arrange
these on crisp lettuce leaves around a cocktail, sundae or other
glass containing the Appetizer Dressing. Serve with an oyster fork.
Dip each tomato and leaf in the Appetizer Dressing just before
eating.</p></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<h4>DEVILLED EGG APPETIZER</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>Use one hard-cooked egg for each individual service. Cut the egg in
half and remove the yolk to a bowl. Add 1 tablespoonful of grated
cheese, 1/4 teaspoonful of salt and a drop of <b>Lea &amp; Perrins'
Sauce</b> to each yolk of egg. Cream all together and refill egg
white. Cut each egg half into four quarter pieces and place on
lettuce leaves. Arrange the Appetizer Dressing in a glass in center
of plate. Serve with oyster fork.</p></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<h4>BEET BALL APPETIZER</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>Cut small balls from a cooked beet with a fancy potato ball
cutter, or cut a small beet into quarters and recut each quarter
into suitable sizes. Place the cut beets in a bowl and cover with

<h3>HOW TO IMPROVE DRESSINGS AND GRAVIES WITH LEA &amp; PERRINS' SAUCE</h3>


<p>After all, there are only a certain number of meats and fishes&mdash;and a
tiresomely small number, too, we often think. But the thing that makes
them seem more varied&mdash;the different feature of each is the dressing
or gravy that is served with them&mdash;the dressing which is made through
the inimitable flavor of <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b>, a distinguishing
addition to the dish.</p>

<p>The zest, the piquancy, the keen edge which <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b>
gives to a dressing or gravy has long been known and used to advantage
by the high-salaried chefs of our luxurious restaurants and hotels.
And now that the chef's secret is known, every homemaker has at her
fingers' ends the basic knowledge for creating from one or two recipes
an infinite variety of rich, delicious dressings that will transform
the plainest food and make the simplest home meal an appetizing repast.</p>

<p>Foods that are too dry can be bettered with a thin dressing&mdash;enhanced
by the addition of <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b>; for more moist foods
a thicker gravy, also seasoned with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce, should be
added. Plain dishes may be embellished, rich dishes "toned down" with
contrasting flavors.</p>

<p>But whether the dressing be thick or thin, mild or rich, the addition
of <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b> improves beyond your expectation the
recipe wherein it is used. Its flavor cannot be imitated, and it has
never been equalled. It is the original Worcestershire&mdash;and the only
all-perfect seasoning.</p>

<p><b>Lea &amp; Perrins</b> are the sole manufacturers of the Original
Worcestershire Sauce. Be sure to add <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b> to all
recipes.</p>


<h3>DIFFERENT KINDS OF DRESSINGS</h3>

<p>There are two big classes of dressings, brown and white. The brown
dressings are usually made with meat juices or extracts known as
"stock," or by first browning the flour which is used to thicken them.
The white or cream dressings are made with white stock, the water in
which vegetables, onion, celery, rice, chicken or mutton have been
cooked, milk or cream as the liquid ingredient, and thickened with
white flour. The brown dressings are more frequently served with meats,
poultry and game, the white or cream dressings with fish and vegetables.</p>

<p>Dressings are also named by the main ingredient from which they gain
their flavor, as Mushroom Dressing, Tomato Dressing, Mint Dressing,
Cheese Dressing.</p>

<p>Other dressings are classified by the ingredient with which they are
thickened, as Flour and Butter Dressings, Cornstarch Dressings, Egg
Dressings and Drawn Butter Dressings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>


<h3>HOW AND WHEN TO SEASON DRESSINGS WITH LEA &amp; PERRINS' SAUCE</h3>

<p>To procure the full zest, piquancy and flavor of <b>Lea &amp; Perrins'
Sauce</b> in seasoning any dressing or gravy, you must add the Lea &amp;
Perrins' Sauce just before removing the dressing from the fire. If
the dressing must stand for any length of time, do not add <b>Lea &amp;
Perrins' Sauce</b> until just before serving time.</p>

<p>The proportion of <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b> to add to meat
dressings and gravies is, for an average taste, about two teaspoonfuls
of <b>Lea &amp; Perrins'</b> to every cupful of dressing. To delicate
white stock dressings and vegetable sauces, in which the flavor of the
vegetable should dominate, use one-half of a teaspoonful of <b>Lea &amp;
Perrins' Sauce</b> to every cupful of dressing.</p>

<p>When such vegetables as onion, bay leaf, carrots or other highly
seasoned vegetables are used in a sauce, they should be cooked in
the butter or fat with which the sauce is made before the liquid is
added. But if the vegetable which is used in the dressing is to be
retained in the sauce, it is frequently added after the dressing has
been completed. This is the case when chopped olives, asparagus tips,
mushrooms and other vegetables are used.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>


<h3>CHOWDERS AND SOUPS</h3>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>In soups and chowders, where herbs and spices are such an important
element, <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b>, an unusual blending of many
spices and flavors, forms the finest possible addition. It will blend
with whatever herb, spice or vegetable the recipe requires, and in
cases where certain spices are hard to obtain it will, with its own
inimitable piquancy, give the dish a perfect, complete and unequalled
flavor.</p>

<p>In earlier days the fishermen each brought their own share of fish to
the big family caldron, and when the dish, which contained biscuits,
onions and a "hodge-podge" of other vegetables, was finished, the
members of the family received an equal share. So a real genuine
chowder should be composed of fish, although we have to-day many
combinations of vegetable chowders.</p>


<blockquote>
<h4>FISH CHOWDER</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<ul>
  <li>1 tablespoonful of <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b>.</li>
  <li>3 pounds of fish.</li>
  <li>1/4 pound of salt pork.</li>
  <li>10 large potatoes.</li>
  <li>1 onion.</li>
  <li>12 soda crackers.</li>
  <li>Salt.</li>
  <li>3 cupfuls of white stock or rice water.</li>
  <li>3 tablespoonfuls of flour.</li>
  <li>4 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any fresh, white fish may be used. Skin the fish, remove the fleshy
part and cover the bones, head and skin with water. Let simmer for
half an hour. Add the onion with the salt pork, both cut in small
pieces. Strain this liquid through a fine strainer and pour over the
white flaky part of the fish.</p>

<p>Add the potatoes cut in small pieces, salt, and simmer until the
potatoes are tender. Then add the white stock or rice water and the
soda crackers cut in half and spread with part of the butter.</p>

<p>Melt the rest of butter. Stir in the flour and add part of the
liquid stock from the fish to make a smooth paste. Pour this back
into the chowder to thicken it. Add the <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b>.
Serve in soup plates or from a soup tureen.</p></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<h4>NEW YORK FISH CHOWDER</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>For this chowder use 3 cupfuls of tomato juice in place of the white
stock or rice water, and 1 cupful of freshly crumbled bread in place
of the soda crackers in the above recipe. Also add a bit of parsley.
Cook and serve as usual.</p></blockquote>

<h4>CLAM CHOWDER</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>For this use 20 clams in place of the fish in the above recipe. Sort
and wash them thoroughly. Allow to stand in cold water for half an
hour, drain off the water, straining it through several thicknesses
of cheese cloth. Scald the clams in this water and use the water
in place of the stock or rice water in making the chowder. Make a
sauce from the clam liquor, the butter and the flour, and add the
potatoes, clams, onion and <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b> to this. Add
crackers last.</p></blockquote>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>For this chowder use in place of the fish given in the Fish Chowder

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>CROQUETTES, TIMBALES, CASSEROLES, STEWS AND OTHER MEAT DISHES</h3>

<p class="center p-left p0"><b>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b></p>

<p>One of the greatest problems in the average household is what to do
with meat, fish or vegetables which are of too small a quantity to
serve alone and yet too worth-while to be wasted. Deliciously seasoned
with <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b>, croquettes, cutlets, meat cakes or
creamed dishes, served in attractive bread and pastry cases, not only
help to keep down the meat bill, but also to keep up the family's
enthusiasm for mother's cooking. By forming the well-known cone-shaped
croquette into a cylinder-shaped or a crescent-shaped cutlet, and
serving it with any one of the delicious Spanish, Creole, Tomato or
Mushroom Dressings given in <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II</a>, an old recipe is made into a
new dinner surprise.</p>


<blockquote>
<h4>BASIC RECIPE FOR CROQUETTES</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<ul>
  <li>2 tablespoonfuls of <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b>.</li>
  <li>4 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
  <li>8 tablespoonfuls of flour.</li>
  <li>1-1/3 cupfuls of stock or rice water.</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoonful of salt.</li>
  <li>2 cupfuls of cooked meat.</li>
  <li>1 egg.</li>
  <li>Bread crumbs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Melt the butter, add the salt, remove from fire and stir in the
flour until smooth. Add the stock or rice water slowly, stirring
constantly, until all is added and boil for five minutes, or until
thick and creamy. Add the cooked meat, ground, the <b>Lea &amp; Perrins'
Sauce</b>, and cool.</p>

<p>When thoroughly chilled, pat mixture into desired cylinder or cutlet
shape and roll in bread crumbs. Beat the egg until well blended,
adding to it 1 tablespoonful of melted butter and 3 tablespoonfuls
of water. Dip the croquette in this egg mixture, roll in the bread
crumbs again, and put into the ice-box for an hour or more to harden
before frying.</p>

<p>Fry in deep fat or oil which will brown a cube of bread to a golden
brown in 40 seconds. Do not fry croquettes for more than 40 seconds.
Drain in frying basket or on brown paper.</p>

<p>If desired, pour 2 tablespoonfuls of oil or melted fat over the
unfried croquettes and bake in a very hot oven for from five to
eight minutes, dressing occasionally with more oil if necessary.</p>

<p>Serve with Tomato, Cheese, Mushroom or Hollandaise sauce given in
<a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II.</a></p>

<p>If croquettes have been shaped into cutlets, a macaroni stick is
usually stuck in the pointed end to imitate a chop bone.</p></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<h4>VEAL CROQUETTES</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>A delicious combination calls for 1 cupful of cooked and cubed veal
and 1/2 cupful of rice in place of the meat required in the above
recipe. Proceed as usual, shaping the croquette into cutlet or chop
shape. Serve with a Tomato, Spanish, Creole or a Mushroom dressing.</p></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<h4>CHICKEN CUTLETS</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>For this use 1-1/2 cupfuls of cooked cubed chicken, or 1 cupful of
chicken and 1/2 cupful of cooked sweetbreads, celery or mushrooms as
desired, in the Basic Croquette recipe. Serve with White, Celery or
Oyster dressing given on page 10.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>


<blockquote>
<h4>RICE CROQUETTES</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<ul>
  <li>2 tablespoonfuls of <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b>.</li>
  <li>4 cupfuls of cooked rice.</li>
  <li>1/4 cupful of grated cheese.</li>
  <li>2 eggs.</li>
  <li>Bread crumbs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Add the grated cheese to the rice and bind the mixture together with
1 well-beaten egg to which 2 tablespoonfuls of water has been added.
Add the <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b>. If too stiff, add a little more
water, form into croquettes, roll in bread crumbs, beaten egg and bread
crumbs again and chill. Fry in fat hot enough to brown a cube of bread
in 40 seconds. Drain and serve with Spanish or Creole dressing. These
croquettes may form the basis of a luncheon menu or may be served as a
vegetable or side dish for dinner.</p></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<h4>MACARONI CROQUETTES</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>Cut cooked macaroni into fine pieces, and measure four cupfuls. Add 1/2
cupful of grated cheese, bind the mixture together with 1 well-beaten
egg, add 2 tablespoonfuls of <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b>, a little more
water if the mixture is too stiff to mold, shape into croquettes, chill
and fry as usual.</p></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<h4>PEANUT OR WALNUT CROQUETTES</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>Use 4 cupfuls of ground peanuts or walnuts in place of meat in the
Basic Croquette recipe. Add enough of the croquette sauce to the nuts
to make them easy to mold. Shape into croquettes, roll in bread crumbs,
egg and crumbs again and chill. Fry as usual.</p></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<h4>SWEET POTATO CROQUETTES</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>These are made the same way as the rice croquettes, using sweet
potatoes in place of the rice in the Rice Croquettes recipe and
omitting the cheese.</p></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<h4>MUSHROOM CROQUETTES</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>For these use 2 cupfuls of chopped mushrooms in making the Basic
Croquette recipe. Add to them just enough of the croquette sauce to
mold firmly together. Shape and fry as usual. Serve with a Cream,
Hollandaise or Bearnaise Sauce.</p></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<h4>SALMON CUTLETS</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>Use 2 cupfuls of canned salmon and 2 cupfuls of cooked rice, adding
2-1/2 tablespoonfuls of <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b>, 1/2 teaspoonful of
salt and 1 tablespoonful of lemon juice. Bind together with an egg and
shape into croquettes, rolling in bread crumbs and beaten egg as usual.
Fry and serve with Tomato, Bearnaise or Hollandaise Sauce.</p></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<h4>FISH CUTLETS</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>Proceed as in making Salmon Cutlets, using the same proportions of any
preferred cooked fish.</p></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<h4>SURPRISE CROQUETTES</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>Press into the center of fish or meat croquettes, just before rolling
in the bread crumbs, a raw oyster, a cooked mushroom, a stuffed olive
or a piece of hard-cooked devilled egg. When the croquette is eaten the
diner is delighted to find in the center this spicy surprise.</p></blockquote>

<h3>TIMBALES</h3>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>Timbales are in reality very fine croquette mixtures, pressed into
individual molds and poached in hot water or baked in the oven. In
making timbales the meat, fish or vegetable is pounded or mashed until
it is very fine and added to a very thick white sauce. This is poured
into an oiled mold which is lined with buttered bread crumbs, macaroni,
spaghetti, olives, peas or fancy cut pimentos.</p>


<blockquote>
<h4>BASIC SAUCE FOR TIMBALES</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<ul>
  <li>1 teaspoonful of <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b>.</li>
  <li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
  <li>1/2 cupful of flour.</li>
  <li>1/2 cupful of boiling water.</li>
  <li>1 egg.</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoonful of salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Melt the butter and stir in half of the flour. Add half of the
boiling water, stir until smooth. Add the rest of the flour slowly,
stirring constantly, so that no lumps will be formed, and the rest
of the boiling water, and the salt. Cook, stirring constantly to
prevent scorching, until the whole sauce will leave the pan in one
thick mass. Remove from fire and beat the egg, which has been well
beaten, into the mixture. Add <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b>. Allow to
cool, add desired ingredient and pour into buttered or oiled timbale
molds and poach in hot water.</p></blockquote>

<h3>STEWS AND CASSEROLE DISHES</h3>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>In stews and casserole dishes our object is to make tender by slow,
long cooking the meat selected, besides cooking with it herbs, spices
and vegetables to supplement and flavor it.</p>

<p>Of all the spices and herbs which it is possible to add to these
casserole dishes and stews, there is no seasoning that will produce
just that zestful, appetizing flavor which <b>Lea &amp; Perrins'
Sauce</b>&mdash;itself a secret blend of the finest spices&mdash;gives.</p>

<p>Use it freely in seasoning all kinds of long-cooked meat
dishes&mdash;goulashes, pot roasts, ragouts, stews, casseroles and meat
pies. Use it also in making meat loaf and rolled meated dishes, in
croquettes and timbales. In fact, wherever you use meat in cooking,
remember to&mdash;</p>

  <li>1 carrot.</li>
  <li>6 potatoes.</li>
  <li>1 turnip.</li>
  <li>6 cupfuls of water.</li>
  <li>1 green pepper.</li>
</ul>

<p>Select a piece of shin meat, the flank end of a roast or a cut of
the chuck ribs, as these contain fat meat, lean meat and a little
bone, all of which are necessary to a good stew.</p>

<p>Cut the meat from the bones, wipe the bones carefully to remove any
small cracked pieces and place in stewing kettle. Add the 6 cupfuls
of boiling water.</p>

<p>Melt a piece of fat, from the meat, in a shallow pan and cook the
cut onion in it until brown. Slice and brown the carrot and turnip,
and add to the kettle.</p>

<p>Braise the meat in these same fat drippings, turning frequently and
cooking on all sides until white, which closes the meat tubes and
keeps the juices within the meat during the long, slow cooking that
follows. Add the meat and the drippings in which it was cooked to
the stewing kettle. Remove seeds and pulp from pepper and add to the
stew.</p>

<p>Simmer slowly for three hours or until the meat is tender. Skim the
fat from the kettle and remove the bones. Add the potatoes, which
have been washed, peeled and cut in quarters. Cook until these are
done and the meat will be ready to serve. Add the <b>Lea &amp; Perrins'
Sauce</b>. Arrange the carrot, turnip, onion, pepper and potato
around the meat on a platter. Thicken the stock left in the kettle
with shortening and flour. Add an extra teaspoonful of <b>Lea &amp;

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>EGGS, OMELETS, SOUFFLES, CREOLE AND RICE DISHES</h3>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>It is almost unbelievable until you have tried it&mdash;to discover how
surprisingly delicious just a drop or two of <b>Lea &amp; Perrins'
Sauce</b> can make a soft-boiled breakfast egg taste. And when you have
tried it, you will want furthermore to fry and poach, scramble, omelet
and soufflé all of the eggs that you cook with just a little of Lea &amp;
Perrins' Sauce added as an inimitable seasoning.</p>


<blockquote>
<h4>SOFT-BOILED EGG</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>There are several ways of cooking a soft-boiled egg&mdash;the best of
which is not to boil it at all.</p>

<p>Use one pint of <i>boiling</i> water for each egg to be cooked. Carefully
lower the egg into the water, cover the saucepan and let stand on
back of stove for eight or ten minutes. Do not increase or diminish
heat. The white of the egg will be tender and the yolk firm all the
way through, instead of the yolk being partly uncooked and the white
very tough as is the case with a three-minute boiled egg.</p>

<p>Still another way is to put the egg on in cold water and remove as
soon as the water boils.</p>

<p>Remove egg from shell to a hot egg cup and add a large piece
of butter, a bit of salt and 2 or 3 drops of <b>Lea &amp; Perrins'
Sauce</b>. Blend well and serve at once.</p></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<h4>FRIED EGGS</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>Eggs should never be fried, as this method of cooking, like boiling,
toughens the albumen. However, if your family must have fried eggs,
you will find the addition of a teaspoonful of <b>Lea &amp; Perrins'
Sauce</b> to the fat in which they are cooked a decided improvement
to the eggs. Put the <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b> on the table and
serve with the eggs.</p></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<h4>POACHED EGGS</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>Brush a heavy iron frying pan with oil and add boiling water to the
depth of an inch or more. Add 1 tablespoonful of <b>Lea &amp; Perrins'
Sauce</b> and a pinch of salt. Break fresh eggs into a saucer and
gently slip from saucer to water. Cook without allowing water to
boil until the egg is firm. Remove with skimmer or quickly dip piece
of toast under egg and lift out at once. Drain, then put on hot
plate and serve. If one is fortunate enough to have an egg poacher,
poaching eggs is an even simpler matter. Serve with <i>Lea &amp; Perrins'
Sauce</i> on the table.</p></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<h4>BAKED EGG</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>Grease an individual glass or fire-proof ramekin with oil or butter
and break an egg into it. Sprinkle with salt and season with a few
drops of <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b>. Bake surrounded by water in a
moderate oven for from five to ten minutes and serve with <b>Lea &amp;
Perrins' Sauce</b> at the table.</p></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<h4>EGG IN NEST</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>Beat the white of an egg with a sprinkling of salt until light and
frothy and pile on top of a piece of toast in an individual ovenware
dish. Make a slight dent on the top of the egg white and carefully
place the yolk in the center; add a drop of <b>Lea &amp; Perrins'
Sauce</b>. Place in a pan of water and cook in a moderate oven until
yolk and white are set. Serve with <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b> at
the table.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>


<blockquote>
<h4>SHIRRED EGG</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>Add 1 teaspoonful of <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b> to 2 tablespoonfuls
of finely chopped ham or bacon and 2 tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs.
Add enough oil or butter to blend well, and press against the
buttered sides and bottom of an individual baking dish. Break an egg
into the dish and sprinkle top with buttered bread crumbs. Bake in
a moderate oven, the dish being surrounded with hot water. Serve in
the dish in which it was baked with <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b> at
the table. Mashed potato, spinach or tomato are often used to fill
sides and bottom of ramekin.</p></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<h4>SCRAMBLED EGGS</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>In Scrambling eggs, great care should be exercised in the cooking,
the mixture being of a custard-like, creamy consistency when
finished, and not dry and lumpy as some scrambled eggs become. The
secret is in allowing the egg to cook as much in the heat of the pan
as over the fire. Keep stirring the mixture constantly removing the
pan from the fire if the eggs seem to get too dry in any one spot.</p>

<p>In scrambling eggs, beat the egg until light and add for each egg
used, 2 tablespoonfuls of water and a few drops of <b>Lea &amp; Perrins'
Sauce</b>.</p></blockquote>


<h3>OMELETS AND SOUFFLES</h3>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>An omelet may be made with or without separating the yolks and whites
of the eggs, the one being called a plain&mdash;the other a fluffy omelet. A
soufflé is a fluffy omelet made with a white sauce foundation and baked
in the oven.</p>

<p>Cheese, tomatoes, chopped meats and vegetables are all attractive
additions to these dishes, but, no matter what else may be added,
<b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b> as a seasoning for omelets and soufflés
cannot be equalled.</p>


<blockquote>
<h4>PLAIN OMELET</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<ul>
  <li>1 tablespoonful of <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b>.</li>
  <li>3 eggs.</li>
  <li>3 tablespoonfuls of water.</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoonful of salt.</li>
  <li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat the eggs without separating and add the water. Add the salt,
the butter melted and the <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b>.</p>

<p>Heat a heavy iron frying pan and grease well with oil, bacon fat
or shortening. Pour in the egg and lower heat under pan. Tilt pan
backward and forward and from side to side, allowing liquid to run
under egg as it cooks. When cooked throughout, run spatulate or
knife under omelet and roll it into a roll. Turn out on platter and
serve with toast or any desired addition.</p></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<h4>FLUFFY OMELET</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<ul>
  <li>1 tablespoonful of <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b>.</li>
  <li>4 eggs.</li>
  <li>6 tablespoonfuls of water.</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoonful of salt.</li>
  <li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Separate the eggs; add the water, salt and melted butter to the
yolks. Also add the <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b>. Beat the whites
until light and frothy and carefully fold them into the yolks.</p>

<p>Grease a heavy iron pan with bacon fat and pour in the omelet. Lower
heat under pan and let cook slowly until brown on the bottom and
almost dry. Place lid over pan and let dry on top, or place in oven
for two minutes.</p>

<p>Cut the omelet lightly on the top and fold over without breaking
under part. Turn out on platter and serve at once.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>


<blockquote>
<h4>TOMATO OMELET</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

over the finished dish.</p></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<h4>SPANISH OMELET</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>Just before folding omelet over, spread with the following mixture and
pour what is left, over the whole omelet after it is placed on the
platter: 2 finely chopped onions, 1 chopped green pepper, a few cut
olives, and, if possible, a few mushrooms. Sauté these ingredients in 2
teaspoonfuls of oil, add 1 cupful of tomato juice and spread in between
and pour over omelet.</p></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<h4>CORN OMELET</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>Spread the omelet with cooked corn before folding.</p></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<h4>VEGETABLE OMELET</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>Spread the omelet with any desired combination of, or individually
cooked vegetable, as peas, carrots, asparagus, cauliflower, onions.
This also helps to use up any vegetables of which too small a quantity
has been left to permit using them alone. The vegetable used should be
heated in a little butter or cooking oil to which a few drops of <b>Lea
&amp; Perrins' Sauce</b> have been added.</p></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<h4>CHEESE OMELET</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>Sprinkle grated cheese over the omelet before and after folding. Or add
1/2 cupful of grated cheese to the omelet in the making.</p></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<h4>BACON OMELET</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>Fry four or five slices of bacon until crisp. Use the bacon drippings
in place of the butter in making and frying the omelet. Spread the
bacon, cut into small pieces, on the omelet before folding. Garnish the
plate with bacon. Serve at once.</p></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<h4>HAM OMELET</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>Chop previously fried ham very fine and reheat in some fat to which
<b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b> has been added. Spread on omelet.</p></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<h4>SARDINE OMELET</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>Sauté some sardines in a little cooking oil to which <b>Lea &amp; Perrins'
Sauce</b> has been added and spread on omelet before folding.</p></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<h4>KIDNEY OR CHICKEN LIVER OMELET</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>Reheat previously cooked chicken livers or kidneys in a little cooking
oil to which <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b> has been added and spread on
omelet before folding. Pour a little kidney or liver gravy over omelet.</p></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<h4>PLAIN SOUFFLÉ</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<ul>
  <li>1 tablespoonful of <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b>.</li>
  <li>2 tablespoonfuls of shortening.</li>
  <li>2 tablespoonfuls of flour.</li>
  <li>1/2 cupful of milk or water.</li>
  <li>3 eggs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Melt the shortening, stir in the flour until smooth, remove from the
fire and slowly stir in the liquid. Add the salt and cook for three or
four minutes or until a thick, smooth sauce is made. Beat the yolks of
the eggs until creamy and add to the sauce. Remove from the fire and
add the stiffly-beaten whites of the eggs. Add the <b>Lea &amp; Perrins'
Sauce</b>. Pour into a buttered baking dish, place dish in a pan of hot
water and bake in a slow oven for twenty or twenty-five minutes. Serve
at once.</p>

<p>The dish in which a soufflé is baked should be broad and wide, rather
than high and narrow, to prevent the soufflé from rising too high in
the center and then falling. It is a big help to pin a buttered paper
band around a soufflé dish before baking, so that it will rise easily
without overflowing.</p></blockquote>

<p>At no other time do we so desire tasty, spicy piquant food as when we
have a chafing dish supper. And there is no other dish wherein the
supreme quality of <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b> shows off to better
advantage than in the chafing dish recipe. For the midnight college
spread&mdash;the Welsh, Cheese or Tomato Rarebits&mdash;for the kitchenette
apartment dinner of Creamed Dried Beef, Ham, Shrimps or Eggs, or
for the simple home Sunday night supper of Creamed Oysters, Chicken
or Chicken à la King&mdash;<b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b>&mdash;the original
Worcestershire&mdash;forms the unsurpassed, the perfect seasoning.</p>

<p>A chafing dish is composed of two flat pans, one called the blazer,
the other the hot-water pan. The usual chafing dish recipe directs the
first cooking of the material to be directly over the heat&mdash;and is
finished and the food kept hot over the hot-water pan.</p>

<p>The chafing dish, particularly if it is one in which alcohol is the
heating element, should always be placed on a tray, to avoid any danger
from fire or a possible "boiling over" of the food. A wooden or chafing
dish spoon is a help although not essential. The butter, flour and
things necessary for the dish to be made should be measured and placed
on the tray besides the chafing dish so that the recipe may be made
up without hurry or getting up and down from the table. With electric
grills the toast may be made under the grill while the other things are
cooking above.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>SANDWICH FILLINGS</h3>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<p>Delicious and different sandwich fillings, for picnics or party
refreshments, depend for their distinction, not so much upon the meat
or cheese which is used as a filling, but upon the seasoning. <b>Lea &amp;
Perrins' Sauce</b>, which is so delicious with meat or cheese, adds an
unequalled and spicy touch in the seasoning of sandwiches.</p>

<p>Bread for sandwiches should not be over a day old. In buttering
the bread, always cream the butter first in a bowl and then spread
the bread evenly with the softened butter. If saving crusts is not
necessary, it is very nice to remove these, cutting the bread into
fancy shaped slices. If a large number of sandwiches are made up for a
reception, it is best to wrap them in a wet cheese-cloth and keep them
wrapped until ready to serve.</p>


<h3>CHEESE SANDWICH FILLINGS</h3>


<blockquote>

cheese add 2 teaspoonfuls of <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b>.</p>

<h3>CATSUPS, CHUTNEYS, PICKLES AND HOME-MADE RELISHES</h3>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>


<p>In pickling, we think first of Grandmother and the delicious catsups,
pickles and chutneys which she served with Sunday-night suppers and
wonder why we see these delicious relishes so seldom these days. But we
need not forego our home-made catsups, pickles and chow-chows, nor even
find them less relishing because we have no herb garden, for in <i><b>Lea
&amp; Perrins' Sauce</b></i> we have the most complete&mdash;the most ideal and
perfect relish seasoning.</p>

<p><b>Lea &amp; Perrins'</b> Original Worcestershire is in itself a secret
blending of spices which will give to any home-made relish the keen
edge&mdash;the snap&mdash;the zest it requires.</p>

<p>Use <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b> in seasoning catsups, chow-chows,
pickles, vinegars, chutneys, piccalilli and chilli sauce relishes&mdash;it
is the unequalled spice for them all.</p>

<h4>AN UNCOOKED TOMATO CATSUP</h4>

<p class="center p-left p0"><i>Improved with Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</i></p>

<ul>
  <li>4 tablespoonfuls of <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b>.</li>
  <li>2 quarts of red ripe tomatoes.</li>
  <li>1 cupful of onions.</li>
  <li>1/4 cupful of salt.</li>
  <li>1 cupful of sugar.</li>
  <li>3 cupfuls of vinegar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dip the tomatoes quickly into rapidly boiling water, dip in and out
of cold water and peel. Put into large preserving kettle and add
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> onions well chopped. Mash these two together and add the salt,
sugar, vinegar and last, the <b>Lea &amp; Perrins' Sauce</b>. Thoroughly
sterilize catsup bottles by boiling and fill with the cold catsup.
Cork loosely. Place bottles on a wire rack, stand in a pan which
allows rapidly boiling water to come to the neck of the bottle, and
boil or sterilize for thirty minutes. Some experts claim this final
"water bath" to be unnecessary, but the inexperienced preserver will
have better success if the last cooking is performed.</p>

<p>For perfect keeping and especially if the catsups are made up to
sell, the corks should be driven in tightly and the bottles sealed
with sealing wax or melted paraffin as soon as they are removed from
the water bath. Stamping the soft wax or paraffin with a special
sealing stamp also helps to give an identifying and distinguishing
mark to the product.</p></blockquote>
